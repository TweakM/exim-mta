UNSOLICITED EMAIL
-----------------

The use, supply or promotion of Exim for the purpose of sending bulk,
unsolicited electronic mail is incompatible with the basic aims of the program,
which revolve around the free provision of a service that enhances the quality
of personal communications. The author of Exim regards indiscriminate
mass-mailing as an antisocial, irresponsible abuse of the Internet.


INCORPORATED CODE
-----------------

Three pieces of external code are included in the Exim distribution.

  1. Regular expressions are supported in the main Exim program and in the
  Exim monitor using the freely-distributable PCRE library, copyright
  (c) 1999 University of Cambridge. The source is distributed in the
  directory src/pcre.

  2. Support for the cdb (Constant DataBase) lookup method is provided by
  code contributed by Nigel Metheringham of Planet Online Ltd. which contains
  the following statements:
